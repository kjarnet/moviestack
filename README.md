Moviestack.net
==============
A simple, personal movie db running on Ruby on Rails.

This project has been abandoned for a while.
I plan to reboot it as soon as I get more spare-time
(hopefully from summer 2014).


Todo
----
 - Start anew with Rails 4.x and Ruby 2.x
 - (Continue from step 4 in the getting started guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#hello-rails)

Licence
