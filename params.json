{"name":"Moviestack","body":"This is just a simple placeholder site for my upcoming Moviestack web-app. The app is just a hobby project for my personal use and will probably not get much documentation, but you're free to browse the code and wiki on github. Also, if you have any questions to or interest in the project, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n### About the app\r\nMoviestack(.net) is my first ruby on rails project (after recently ditching django), and the plan is to make a very simple website to organize my list of to-watch and watched movies. The goal is to provide an interface to type in a movie-name, and have the app find relevant info such as reviews and cinema-details automatically. There may very well exist a site with similar functionality already (if you know of any, I would greatly appreciate if you told me), but the project primarily serves as an experiment to get to learn rails. \r\n\r\n### The technology used\r\nI intend to make a very simple rest-backend with ruby on rails, serving a single-page ajax frontend with some sort of javascript mvc framework (most likely backbone, or perhaps spine).\r\n","tagline":"a simple, personal movie db","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
